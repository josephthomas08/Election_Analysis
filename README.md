# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview 

Seth has approached us to work with Tom on the election analysis with the power of Python. 

Once Seth provided the basic introduction of Python to Tom and the team, we were provided with. csv data set of election results, which were advised to go through with Tom and store the same in new folder resources within the Election_Analysis folder.

In this project, our final Python script should be able to deliver the following information when the script is run: 

1. Total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Total number of votes each candidate received
4. Percentage of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources
Data set provided in CSV format
Python 3.7.6 version was used for this project

## Summary
The analysis of the election shows that :
1. The total votes casted for the election was 369,711
2. The number of candidates for the election were three and they were 
      1. Candidate #1 :Charles Casper Stockham
      2. Candidate #2 :Diana DeGette
      3. Candidate #3 :Raymon Anthony Doane
3. Totoal number of votes each cnadiate won were :

      Charles Casper Stockham: 85,213
      Diana DeGette: 272,892
      Raymon Anthony Doane:11,606
      
4. the percentage of votes each candidate had got were 

      Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
      Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
      Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
      
      
5. the winner of the election was Diana with vote in favor for her counted as 272,892.


## Challenge overview 

It was great challenge to automate the election_results with Tom and Seth with the help of python and looking forward to wroking with them to provide better and faster dashboard view on on future results.
